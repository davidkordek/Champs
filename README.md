Known bugs-
When clicking abilities, There is a timer that will start and after some time it will remove all the p's.
The timer should only start when the first ability is clicked, but with the current code it will still have a timer to remove all p's when a button after the first is pressed.
This makes it so you have to wait out the timer before you want to start another combo.
