Known bugs-
When you click an ability, There is a timer that will start and after some time it will remove all the p's.
The timer should only start when the first ability is clicked, but currently it will start a timer for each time an ability is clicked and after each one, it will remove all the paragraphs that represent the ability you pressed.
This makes it so you have to wait out the timer before you want to start another combo.

In the future I will make each ability have their own seperate cooldown and it will work differently most likely.
